Short Sea bulk and general-cargo ships spend 40%-60% of their time on average sailing empty. Shortcut is a web based marketplace where ship operators and cargo owners can meet, optimize and plan their routes and production.

## Problem

* Very low utilization rates of Cargo fleet, and much time spent in ports.
* High number of actors involved, up to 15 organizations are involved.
* There is no transparency in today´s Short Sea Shipping. Cargo owners consider it a "black box" which leads to inefficiencies.
* Speed profile of vessels are not optimal, rushing to ports and sailing at non optimal speeds.

## Solution

* Introducing a web based marketplace with route and production optimization capabilities. As a result; higher utilization rates and less time spent in ports.
* In other words, Short Sea Shipping must undergo a transformation like Ûber in taxi services and Airbnb in accomodation.
* Shortcut will significantly reduce the number of organizations involved in Short Sea Shipping
